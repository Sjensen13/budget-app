## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm install
   cd ../backend && npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables in both frontend and backend
4. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend && npm start
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm start
   ```

## Database Schema

### Users Table
- id, email, full_name, yearly_income, monthly_expenses, financial_goal, currency

### Budgets Table
- id, user_id, categories (JSON), total_budget, created_at, updated_at

### Transactions Table
- id, user_id, type, category, amount, description, date, created_at, updated_at

## Current Status

The app now has a complete transaction tracking system that integrates with the existing budget management. Users can:

1. Set up their budget categories and amounts
2. Add income and expense transactions
3. View transaction history with filtering
4. See summary statistics (total income, expenses, net balance)
5. Navigate between budget and transaction pages

The next logical step would be to integrate the transaction data with the budget goals to show progress and provide insights.
